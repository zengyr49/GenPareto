# GenPareto
Fitting Generalized Pareto Distribution in a Hybrid Method. Applying Anderson Darling Test to see if the data fits well.
Hybrid Method is refered to "A new hybrid estimation method for the generalized pareto distribution" by Chunlin Wang & Gemai Chen.
AD test is to test whether the function fits the data well. For I didn't find a package to do AD test for Generalized Pareto Distribution.
